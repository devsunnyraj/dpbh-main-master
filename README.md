# **Dark Patterns Buster Hackathon**


## Overview

Welcome to the Dark Patterns Buster Hackathon repository! This project is a collaborative effort to combat deceptive design practices in e-commerce platforms. The goal is to develop innovative solutions that detect and expose dark patterns, fostering a culture of ethical innovation and problem-solving in the digital realm.

## Introduction

Dark patterns are deceptive tactics employed by e-commerce platforms to trick users into unintended actions. This repository addresses the pressing issues related to dark patterns and provides a platform for developers to contribute towards a fairer and more transparent digital landscape.

## Problem Statement

The prevalence of dark patterns erodes user trust and satisfaction, compromising the integrity of online interactions. This project aims to unravel the challenges posed by dark patterns, highlighting their negative impact on user experiences and emphasizing the broader context of ethical UX.

## Proposed Solution

Our solution takes a holistic approach, combining a website and a browser extension. The website fetches URLs of e-commerce platforms and performs backend processing to analyze dark patterns using machine learning. The browser extension provides real-time alerts to users, empowering them to make informed decisions and promoting transparency in online interactions.

## Key Features
